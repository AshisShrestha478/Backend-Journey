# Backend Journey 🚀
Learning by doing, one day at a time.

---

## Day 1 – Backend Setup
- Built a simple GET method and learned basic routing.  
- Ran into an issue with server refresh—accidentally opened two ports. Learned to debug and fix it.  

---

## Day 2 – Routing
- Learned about **route parameters** and **query parameters**.  
- Explored how to use them effectively in routing.  
- Struggled initially with combining queries and parameters, but eventually got it working.  

---

## Day 3 – API Basics
- Built a small API and practiced manipulating data using **filter** and other array methods.  
- Revisited concepts of `filter` and `find`.  
- Initially struggled with conditional logic inside filtering, but eventually understood how it works.
